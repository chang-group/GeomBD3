////////////// TO-DO LIST ///////////////
XXX DONE 7.  Check if rect/hex are starting w rec at bottome automatically or is rec centered?

XXX DONE 9.  Eliminiate useless code for inital Q.xyz assing in sphere code, I think it does nothing

XXX DONE 10. Add in ceiling keyword for top of rect and hex sims

XXX DONE 11. Figure out why model->center.z doesn't work and needs to be commented out currently. *I think b/c z was 0 for test receptor
             we saw no difference between having center.z there vs not there

XXX DONE 12. Figure out bounds_max.z I think has/had a problem of always being 0 no matter what. Check on this in Session.cc

XXX DONE 13. Make uniform keyword format. *Made them all camel case

XXX DONE 14. Make one 'ligandStart' keyword and have it branch to random, points, plane, or NAM. Started..to finish need to 
       check if (token2 && tokne3 not empty)....
       This compiled, now check with test runs
XXX DONE 16. Is there a contractdtion btwn sphere boundaries and ligandStart with one number (ie a bplane height)?
        * Added usePlane bool to send error if sphere used w/ plane*

XXX DONE 17. Check all new ligStart conditions for contradicitons etc
XXX DONE 21. Make no rotation for point starts since they are starting usually from a pocket to avoid atom overlap

XXX DONE 22. Check that sphereical-nonNAM puts receptor at center and rec/hex put it at bottom-center of cell. This is done
    by in rec/hex not letting ligs go below receptor min.z, but in sphere we dont do that
XXX DONE 25. Test what happes is numbers are not floats, but just integers for ligandStart *Its fine, it works normally*
XXX DONE 29. Check off center receptor and how boudnaries work on it. *Works. Boundary is moved relative to rec, rec is not moved to 0 0 0*
XXX DONE 32. Change exBnd variable to wall or boundwall
XXX DONE 36. Small issue may remain with z translate in session.cc (translate() by center.z + Q.z or receptor_min.z + Q.z or just Q.z?)
XXX DONE37. Check once again all boundaries w/ all shapes to confirm still work after changes to code
XXX DONE -- Why does top of sphere have a dent in it w/ no ligands? Tjhis happens on only ranradom start, not nam
XXX DONE -- b/q sphere looks to be centered based on bottom of hairpin, not center. Look with other receptors wher it will be more obvs
    and figure out whats wrong if anything
XXX DONE -- Check if slippage from hex boudnary can be stopped by doing <= or >= on y translate boundaries
XXX DONE -- Make it automatically use restart if restart files -t -c are provided in command
XXX DONE -- Make conv be based on SEM, not SD of running avg
XXx DONE -- Make SEM conv only happen after >50 binders or so
XXX DONE --  Add in timers/counters for individual binding criteria

----------------------------------------------------------

--  Finish new grid shape. After gridder part done, reading in grid files by GBD (Grid_EX.h etc) may also need
    to be updated

--  Add in flow functionality and keyword

--  Delete redundant code (old session keywords udner backwards-compatitblity) and possibly session nam/session indirect are same
    plus whatever else I find

-- Work on Grid-D, test it, it might wokr already. And understand how it works.
     - Tests on CH and OH small surf show that D causes severe stickig on both surfaces.
     - Try it on a charged surf like COO-

-- Test again the LJ scaling necessaryfor agreement w MD. D's masured before may have been wrong

-- Figure out why LJ full values dont work and cause sticking. Try other potential forms, like 8-6 or something? Research this problem,
    what have others used

-- Make it check that start point is within boundary!

-- Clean up input file, reorganize it

-- Figure out where newest AA params are located and make it clear, combine all params if needed

-- Hydrodynamic interactions?

-- ! Can it make more than 1 ex/lj/es grid for multi receptors? Why do grid types have .size() attribute?

-- Check what happens if receptor has negative coordinates.....

-- Make nam beta kon calcs etc only happen for nam settings

-- Clean up output to screen on GBD start

-- For all grids: make it give clearer output w/ padding/param values used, and make ES not need ligand input anymore, as its
   not reqd and v confusing. Check if D needs ligand too and if not, remove that input too

-- Make output file extensions make more sense, leave off *.dcd.* part. Only have dcd on actual dcd.
